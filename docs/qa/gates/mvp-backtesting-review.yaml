summary: |
  The initial development of the Backtesting MVP is functionally complete and aligns well with the requirements outlined in the brainstorming session. The system successfully runs an end-to-end backtest. However, the complete lack of unit tests presents a significant quality risk, and there are notable concerns regarding configuration management and error handling that should be addressed before building new features.

requirements_traceability:
  status: PASS
  details: |
    - The implementation successfully meets all five major steps of the MVP development plan.
    - All new and modified modules directly map to the features described in the requirements.

code_quality:
  status: CONCERNS
  details: |
    - **Configuration Management (Concern):** Backtest parameters are hardcoded in `run_backtest.py`, making the system inflexible. The plan to use command-line arguments or a config file was not fully realized.
    - **Error Handling (Concern):** Error handling is minimal. Unhandled exceptions could occur during database or API operations.
    - **Modularity (Minor Concern):** The Portfolio class mixes calculation and presentation logic, which could be separated for better reusability.
    - **Docstrings & Typing (PASS):** The code is well-documented with good type hinting.

testability_assessment:
  status: FAIL
  details: |
    - **Lack of Unit Tests:** No unit tests were delivered with the MVP. This is a critical gap.
    - **Verification:** It is impossible to programmatically verify the correctness of the portfolio calculations or strategy logic without tests.
    - **Regression Risk:** Future changes could easily introduce bugs that would go undetected.

recommendations:
  - priority: CRITICAL
    action: "Write comprehensive Pytest unit tests for the `Portfolio` class to validate all calculations (cash, positions, P&L)."
    owner: dev
  - priority: HIGH
    action: "Write unit tests for the `SMACrossoverStrategy` to verify its signal generation logic against a known dataset."
    owner: dev
  - priority: HIGH
    action: "Refactor `run_backtest.py` to load backtest parameters from a YAML configuration file instead of hardcoding them."
    owner: dev
  - priority: MEDIUM
    action: "In the `Portfolio` class, separate the P&L calculation logic from the `print_final_summary` method to improve modularity."
