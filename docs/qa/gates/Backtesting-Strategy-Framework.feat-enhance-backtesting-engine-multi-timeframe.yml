summary: |
  The implementation of the multi-timeframe engine enhancement is robust and meets the functional requirements. The developer has done a good job. The unit tests are comprehensive for the functional aspects.

concerns:
  - id: "C-01"
    severity: "Minor"
    description: "Performance degradation (AC4) is not unit tested. This would require dedicated performance tests."
    recommendation: "Conduct performance tests with large datasets and multiple resolutions to ensure no significant degradation."
  - id: "C-02"
    severity: "Minor"
    description: "The `sys.path` modification in the test file (`tests/backtesting/test_engine_multi_timeframe.py`) is a code smell and should be replaced with a proper `pytest` configuration in `pyproject.toml`."
    recommendation: "Update the project's `pyproject.toml` to correctly configure `pytest` for `src` layout and remove the `sys.path` hack."

nextSteps:
  - "Proceed with implementing the dependent story: 'feat-implement-ltp-crossover-count-filter.md'."
  - "Consider creating separate technical debt stories to address the two concerns raised."
