summary: |
  The implementation is of high quality and closely matches the requirements. The developer did an excellent job navigating significant environment issues. The test coverage is good, with only minor gaps. The outstanding issue of data availability is operational and does not reflect on the quality of the code itself.

concerns:
  - id: "C-01"
    severity: "Minor"
    description: "Test coverage should be improved to include the Target 2 exit and the zero-risk entry guard clause."
    recommendation: "Add two new unit test cases to cover these specific scenarios."
  - id: "C-02"
    severity: "Minor"
    description: "The `sys.path` modification in the test file is a code smell and should be replaced with a proper `pytest` configuration in `pyproject.toml`."
    recommendation: "Update the project configuration to handle test path resolution automatically."

nextSteps:
  - "User to populate historical data by running `src/fetch_historical_data.py`."
  - "User to run the final backtest to validate performance against KPIs."
  - "Create new technical debt stories to address the two concerns raised."
