1# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-09-02
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** ramakrishna

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Fyers Paper Trading System

**Session Goals:** A broad exploration of all possibilities for building a full-fledged paper trading system, starting from the existing codebase.

**Techniques Used:**
- The Worst Possible Idea (Warm-up)
- Mind Mapping (Divergent Phase)
- Categorization & Feature Prioritization (Convergent Phase)
- MVP Planning (Synthesis Phase)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 9 major system components.

**Key Themes Identified:**
- The system must be a complete strategy development platform, not just a paper trading tool.
- A clear separation between live trading and backtesting is crucial, while reusing the same strategy logic.
- The system requires a solid data persistence layer for both market data and trade history.
- User interaction is key, with both a GUI for visualization and a CLI for automation and power users.

## Technique Sessions

### Mind Mapping - System Components

**Ideas Generated:**
1.  **Authentication:** Handles Fyers API login.
2.  **Data Collection:** Fetches and stores live market data.
3.  **Data Persistence (Database):** Stores ticks, trades, portfolio history, and logs.
4.  **Scheduler & Market Calendar:** Automates the start/stop of the system based on market hours.
5.  **Strategies:** The individual trading logic modules.
6.  **Trading Engine:** Executes trades in a simulated (paper) environment in real-time.
7.  **Backtesting Engine:** Simulates strategies on historical data.
8.  **Portfolio Management & Reporting:** Analyzes and displays performance.
9.  **User Interface & Control:** The GUI and CLI for interacting with the system.

## Idea Categorization

### Category 1: Core Trading & Strategy
- Authentication
- Strategies
- Trading Engine
- Backtesting Engine

### Category 2: Data & Scheduling
- Data Collection
- Data Persistence (Database)
- Scheduler & Market Calendar

### Category 3: Analysis & User Interaction
- Portfolio Management & Reporting
- User Interface & Control (GUI & CLI)

## Action Planning: MVP (Version 1.0)

The top priority is to build a **Core Backtesting System** that allows for strategy validation on historical data.

### MVP Development Plan

**Step 1: Solidify the Data Foundation**
- **Task 1.1:** Enhance `fetch_symbols.py` to download and store historical data into `ticks.duckdb`.
- **Task 1.2:** Create a dedicated schema in DuckDB for historical data.

**Step 2: Refine the Strategy Framework**
- **Task 2.1:** Improve `strategies/base_strategy.py` to be a universal template for both backtesting and live trading.
- **Task 2.2:** Update `strategies/simple_ma_crossover.py` to conform to the new base strategy.

**Step 3: Build the Backtesting Engine**
- **Task 3.1:** Create `src/backtesting/engine.py`.
- **Task 3.2:** The engine will loop through historical data, feed it to a strategy, and track a simulated portfolio.

**Step 4: Implement Basic Reporting**
- **Task 4.1:** Create `src/reporting/summary.py`.
- **Task 4.2:** This module will calculate and print a basic performance summary (P&L, Win Rate, etc.) to the console.

**Step 5: Create the Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Task 5.1:** Create a top-level `run_backtest.py`.
- **Task 5.2:** Use `argparse` to allow running backtests with different strategies, symbols, and date ranges from the command line.

## Reflection & Follow-up

**What Worked Well:**
- The progressive flow (Divergent -> Convergent -> Synthesis) was very effective in moving from a high-level idea to a concrete plan.
- The MVP prioritization provides a clear and manageable starting point.

**Areas for Further Exploration (Post-MVP):**
- Development of the live paper trading engine.
- Design and implementation of the web-based GUI.
- Integration of more advanced performance metrics in the reporting module.

**Recommended Follow-up:**
- Begin development by tackling Step 1 of the MVP plan.
