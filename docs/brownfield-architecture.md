# Brownfield Architecture: Fyers Trading Platform

*This document was auto-generated by the `document-project` task to reflect the current state of the codebase.*

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a trading platform that interfaces with the Fyers API. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for both backtesting trading strategies against historical data and simulating live paper trading. The primary user interface is a web-based dashboard built with Streamlit, which allows users to configure and run backtests, optimize strategy parameters, and view performance reports and logs.

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, isolating data fetching, strategy logic, portfolio management, and user interface into distinct components.

## 2. Core Components

### `src/auth`
- **Purpose**: Manages the entire Fyers API authentication flow.
- **Key Files**: `auth.py`
- **Functionality**: Handles the OAuth2 process, including generating auth codes, creating access/refresh tokens, and storing them in `fyers_tokens.json`. Provides helper functions to get an authenticated `fyersModel` instance.

### `src/data` & `src/fetch_historical_data.py`
- **Purpose**: Responsible for populating the historical market database.
- **Key Files**: `fetch_historical_data.py`, `archive_live_data.py`
- **Functionality**:
    - `fetch_historical_data.py`: Intelligently fetches historical candle data for multiple resolutions. It handles API rate limits by breaking large date ranges into smaller, valid chunks. On subsequent runs, it only downloads data that is missing, making it highly efficient.
    - `archive_live_data.py`: A daily maintenance script that moves captured live tick data from the temporary live database to the permanent historical database.
    - `check_data_coverage.py`: A utility script to connect to the historical database and print a detailed summary of the data coverage for each symbol and resolution.

### `src/tick_collector.py`
- **Purpose**: A scheduler script that manages the lifecycle of the live trading engine.
- **Functionality**: Starts the `LiveTradingEngine` before market open, stops it after market close, and triggers the `archive_live_data.py` script to clean up daily data.

### `src/paper_trading`
- **Purpose**: Contains the core logic for managing a trading account's state.
- **Key Files**: `portfolio.py`, `oms.py` (Order Management System), `engine.py` (Live Trading Engine)
- **Functionality**:
    - `Portfolio`: Tracks cash, positions, and P&L. It is agnostic to whether it's being used in a backtest or live simulation.
    - `OrderManager`: Simulates or places real orders, updating the portfolio accordingly.
    - `LiveTradingEngine`: Connects to the Fyers WebSocket to process live ticks and pass them to a strategy.

### `src/backtesting`
- **Purpose**: Provides a high-performance, vectorized backtesting engine.
- **Key Files**: `engine.py`
- **Functionality**: Loads historical data from the database, generates all trading signals for a given strategy at once using pandas, and then simulates the trades to produce a performance report. This vectorized approach is significantly faster than event-driven (loop-based) backtesting.

### `src/strategies`
- **Purpose**: Defines the logic for making trading decisions.
- **Key Files**: `base_strategy.py`, `simple_ma_crossover.py`
- **Functionality**: Implements trading strategies. Each strategy must inherit from `BaseStrategy`. The `SMACrossoverStrategy` is the primary example, with methods for both vectorized signal generation (`generate_signals`) for backtesting and live data processing (`on_data`).

### `src/reporting`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes and presents portfolio performance.
- **Key Files**: `performance_analyzer.py`
- **Functionality**: Calculates key metrics like P&L, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, and Win Rate from a completed backtest or live session.

### `web_ui`
- **Purpose**: The main user interface for the application.
- **Key Files**: `dashboard.py`
- **Functionality**: A Streamlit application that allows users to configure and run single backtests or multi-parameter optimizations. It visualizes results with interactive charts and tables and displays logs from the trading database.

## 3. Data Architecture & Flow

The application uses three separate SQLite databases to maintain a clean separation of data. A daily archiving process ensures that live data is managed efficiently.

- **`data/historical_market_data.sqlite`**:
  - **Purpose**: Stores all permanent historical market data.
  - **Tables**:
    - `historical_data`: Contains historical OHLCV candle data.
    - `historical_ticks`: Contains archived tick-by-tick data from live sessions.
  - **Populated By**: `src/fetch_historical_data.py`
  - **Read By**: `src/backtesting/engine.py` and `web_ui/dashboard.py`.

- **`data/live_market_data.sqlite`**:
  - **Purpose**: A temporary database to store live tick data captured during a single trading session.
  - **Lifecycle**: This database is cleared out daily by the archiving script.
  - **Populated By**: `src/paper_trading/engine.py` (LiveTradingEngine)
  - **Read By**: `src/archive_live_data.py`.

- **`data/trading_log.sqlite`**:
  - **Purpose**: Stores the results of trading activity.
  - **Tables**:
    - `paper_trades`: A log of all individual trades from both backtesting and live simulation.
    - `portfolio_log`: A time-series log of portfolio value, used for generating equity curves.
  - **Populated By**: `src/paper_trading/oms.py` and `src/paper_trading/portfolio.py`.
  - **Read By**: `web_ui/dashboard.py` to display live logs.

## 4. Configuration Management

- **`.env` file**: Stores all secrets and environment-specific variables (API keys, credentials, etc.). This file is NOT committed to version control.
- **`config.py`**: Loads variables from the `.env` file and exposes them to the application. It also defines key file paths, ensuring consistency across the project.

## 5. Key Entry Points & Usage

1.  **Initialize the Database Schema**:
    ```bash
    python src/db_setup.py
    ```

2.  **Generate API Tokens (One-time manual step)**:
    ```bash
    python src/auth.py
    ```
    *(Follow the on-screen instructions to log in via browser and paste the redirected URL).*

3.  **Fetch Historical Data**:
    ```bash
    python src/fetch_historical_data.py
    ```

4.  **Run the Dashboard**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run web_ui/dashboard.py
    ```

5.  **Run Live Trading (Optional)**:
    - This is now a scheduled, automated process. To run it, deploy the code to the production environment where it will be managed by a scheduler like `cron`.
    - The main entry point for this process is `src/tick_collector.py`.

## 6. Identified Technical Debt & Risks

- **SQL Injection (Mitigated)**: Initial versions of the code used f-strings to build SQL queries. This has been refactored to use parameterized queries, significantly improving security.
- **Hardcoded Holidays**: The `src/market_calendar.py` file contains a hardcoded list of holidays for 2025. This will need to be updated annually or replaced with a dynamic holiday calendar API.
- **Live Order Execution**: The live order placement in `oms.py` assumes the order is filled at the signal price. A production-grade system would need to poll for the actual fill price and handle partial fills.
- **Error Handling**: While improving, some parts of the application could benefit from more specific error handling and user-friendly feedback, especially around API interactions.
- **Indefinite Tick Growth**: The `historical_ticks` table will grow indefinitely. A future enhancement could involve partitioning this data by month or year into separate files or tables for better performance.
