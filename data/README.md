# Data Directory

This directory contains the SQLite database files used by the application.

**IMPORTANT**: The `.sqlite` files in this directory are generated by the application and contain transient or historical data. They are intentionally excluded from version control by a rule in the root `.gitignore` file.

To create the initial database schema, run the setup script from the project root:
`python src/db_setup.py`
